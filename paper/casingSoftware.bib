abstract = {Pipe corrosion is a natural phenomenon in the harsh environment of oil and gas production wells, costing billions of dollars each year. Monitoring such corrosion allows for timely mitigation to prevent leaks, environmental damage, or catastrophic failures. Corrosion of pipes is inferred from measurement of internal diameter and wall thickness. Mechanical finger calipers provide a high-resolution image of the internal pipe surface. Ultrasonic tools measure both the internal diameter and thickness of a single pipe, providing the pipe is filled with a fluid. Production tubing is a barrier to caliper, ultrasonic, and flux-leakage electromagnetic tools, preventing the assessment of outer casings. Remote-Field Eddy-Current (RFEC) tools respond to the total metal thickness of all the combined casings. The measurement is valid in single and multiple casing strings and is largely insensitive to the kind of material filling the pipe. This paper presents a new slim electromagnetic (EM) imaging tool enabling casing assessment without removing the production tubing. The tool excites eddy-currents in the tubulars using a powerful low-frequency solenoidal transmitter. Distribution and strength of the eddy-currents depend on the geometric properties of the casings, their EM properties, and the presence of defects. The tool operates in the RFEC regime using large transmitter-receiver spacings, in which the measurements directly determine the total metal thickness. Mandrel-mounted coils provide the average total metal thickness, and eighteen small pad sensors around the tool provide an image of local pipe wall metal loss. The combination of low- and high-frequency images, together with the average total metal thickness, provides a quantitative, high-resolution assessment of pipe condition. Log examples show detection of casing joints, additional casings strings, and presence of corrosion damage in the low- and high-frequency images.

abstract = {A simulation and sensitivity analysis has been performed to study the properties of a casing source excited by connecting the electrodes of a long vertical bipole antenna at the top and bottom ends of the pipe. It has been demonstrated that the casing source yields a field distribution that resembles that of the bipole antenna in an open hole. Indeed the casing current can be regarded as an attenuated version of the vertical antenna that excites the pipe. Sensitivity to the properties of finite size targets is well preserved when using the casing source. It has been demonstrated that sensitivity is higher to resistive than conductive targets. The effect of channeling current along the conductor is small, as current flows preferentially along the metallic casing. On the other hands the presence of resistive bodies yields a deviation of the current lines around the resistors which manifests strongly in the current density observed at the surface.},

abstract = {The application of unstructured grids can improve the solution of total field electromagnetic problems as these grids allow the efficient local refinement of the mesh at the locations of high gradient of the fields. This study investigates the generaliza- tion of the standard Yee's staggered scheme to unstructured tetrahedral-Vorono¨ı grids. We discretize the Helmholtz equa- tion for the electric field using a finite volume approach and then solve the problem to find the projection of the total elec- tric field along the edges of the tetrahedral elements. To com- pute the electric and magnetic fields at the observation points an interpolation technique is employed which uses the edge vector basis functions of the tetrahedral elements. Two ex- amples from the preliminary results are included which show the computation of the total and secondary fields due to elec- tric and magnetic sources in halfspaces that contain anomalous bodies. The results show good agreement with those from the literature and analytical solutions.},

abstract = {Electrical logging in cased holes is a subject of strong current interest. In this paper we develop the conventional theory of physical responses of electrical logging through casing where the formation resistivity changes vertically and where the conductance of the casing varies. The theory is developed for a four-electrode sonde with one current electrode, and three receiver electrodes that measure current leakage into the formation. All the theoretical developments in the paper are derived using approximate transmission-line theory. An expression for the array coefficient is first derived and then used to obtain an expression for the apparent conductivity of the formation. Then a relation is established between the array coefficient, geometrical factor and conductance of the casing. This step led to a method of measuring casing conductance. Knowing casing conductance, the response of the array to vertical changes in formation conductivity is measurable. It was established, that when the array length is less than the thickness of the formation layer, the measured apparent conductivity is equivalent to the true conductivity of the formation, unlike the case of normal and induction logs. It was also established that measurement of apparent conductivity can be made accurately inside a casing of finite length when it essentially exceeds the length of the electrode array. The results contained in this paper show that electrical logging through casing is possible in wells with conventional casing strings that penetrate layered sedimentary formations.},

@inproceedings{Marsala2011,
abstract = {The first Borehole to Surface Electromagnetic (BSEM) pilot field survey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was successfully executed to identify oil and water bearing reservoir layers in a carbonate oilfield water injection zone. Maximizing recovery factor by means of detailed mapping of hydrocarbon accumulations in the reservoirs is a key requirement for oil producing companies. This mapping is done routinely by accurate measurements of fluid distribution at the wells' locations, but a knowledge gap exists in the inter-well volumes, where typically only density-based measurements are available (seismic and gravity). Such technologies are not always effective to discriminate and quantify the fluids in the porous space (especially when difference in fluid densities is small, such as oil and water). On the contrary, when high electrical resistivity contrasts exist between hydrocarbons and water, electromagnetic (EM) based technologies have the potential to map the distribution of the fluids and monitor their movement during the life of the field, hundreds of meters or kilometers away from the wellbores. The objective of a BSEM survey is to obtain fluid sensitive resistivity and induced polarization maps. These are based on an acquisition grid at the surface, a few kilometers around the EM transmitting well, which reveal oil and water bearing zones in the investigated reservoir layers. In this pilot field test, BSEM showed the potential to map water-front movements in an area of about 4km from the single well surveyed, evaluate the sweep efficiency, identify bypassed/ lagged oil zones, and eventually monitor the fluid displacements, if surveys are repeated over time. The data quality of the recorded signals is highly satisfactory. Fluid distribution maps obtained with BSEM are coherent with production data measured at the wells' locations, filling the knowledge gap of the inter- wells area. Three key R{\&}D objectives for this BSEM pilot are achieved. Firstly, the capability to record at the surface EM signals generated in the reservoir, secondly, the capability of BSEM to discriminate between oil and water saturated reservoir zones, and finally obtain resistivity maps and a fluid distribution estimate plausible and coherent with the information obtained from well logs, crosswell EM, production data and reservoir models. In addition to reservoir monitoring, BSEM can be very useful in non-diagnosed areas like exploration fields for hydrocarbon exploitations.},

@article{Salazar2012,
abstract = {Unexpected borehole measurements are often inaccurately interpreted due to limited knowledge of the formation, particularly in tight-gas unconventional reservoirs. A novel method was applied to determine reservoir quality and the reliability of borehole array-induction resistivity measurements in a tight gas sandstone reservoir. Four exploration wells drilled with synthetic oil-based mud showed conflicting resistivity profiles. The discovery well showed a conductive invasion profile, but the appraisal wells showed resistive profiles. Simulation of oil-based mud-filtrate invasion was coupled with forward simulation and inversion of array-induction resistivity measurements to determine the difference in such resistivity profiles. Laboratory measurements on rock core and fluid samples were used to calibrate a log-based petrophysical model that was necessary to simulate the physics of fluid-flow mud-filtrate invasion. The dynamic process of invasion was simulated with a multicomponent formulation for the hydrocarbon phase and rock wettability alteration effects due to surfactants present in the mud. Simulated borehole-resistivity measurements were compared to field logs, and the rock properties were modified to secure a close agreement between simulated and field logs. The different invasion profiles corresponded to variable rock quality and mud composition. In the discovery well, good rock quality and thick surfactants in the mud caused a low mobility ratio between filtrate and native fluids, which created a water bank that moved ahead into the formation. This effect created a conductive annulus in the near-wellbore region. In turn, the deep invasion and high resistivity are due to excellent rock quality that is typical of a conventional sandstone reservoir. The shallower invasion and resistive profiles in the delineation wells suggest the tight gas sandstone reservoir we expected to find throughout the formation.},

The feasibility of measuring low-frequency magnetic fields through such steel-cased wells is of great interest for monitoring fluid movement during production. We report on experimental and modeling results regarding the effect of steel casing on electromagnetic signals transmitted through them. This effect includes the attenuation and phase shift of a signal diffusing through the casing wall. Sample casings are studied under low field strength in the linear regime where the casing's electrical properties are independent of the applied signals. Frequency spectra are measured for transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic polariza- tions from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz. Numerical models, devel- oped to simulate the casing response, match the ex- perimental data very well. Finally, studies of the effects of the earth's magnetic field and casing rema- nent magnetization show that these steady biases do not affect the ac signal detection.},
