    (a) Current along a well for 5 different wellbore lengths.
    The x-axis is depth normalized by the length of the well. The black
    dashed line shows the short-well approximation (equation 45 in \cite{Kaufman1993})
    for a 200m long well. The black dash-dot line shows the long-well approximation
    (equation 53 in \cite{Kaufman1993}) for a 4000m well.
    (b) Charge per unit length along the well for 5 different wellbore lengths.
