    Depth slice (left) and cross section (right) through the 3D cylindrical
    mesh used for the comparison with \cite{Commer2015}.
    The source and recievers are positioned along the $\theta = 90^\circ$ line.
    The mesh extends 3600m raidally and 3300m vertically to ensure that the fields
    have sufficiently decayed before reaching the boundaries.
