\caption{
    Magnetic flux density at 0.1Hz in the region of the pipe near the plane of the source for
    (a) the ``infinite'' pipe, where the source is located at -4.5m and the pipe extends from 0m to -9m,
    (b) a ``semi-infinite'' pipe, where the source is located at 0m and the pipe extends to -9m.
    In (c), we zoom in to the top 5cm of the ``semi-infinite'' pipe,
    and (d) shows the 5cm at the top-end of the ``infinite'' pipe.
