abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.Electric resistivity tomography (ERT) is a widespread technique used for geologic and hydrological subsurface characterization. The 3D application is limited to small scales due to the enormous effort required for field surveys. Long-electrode (LE)-ERT using steel-cased boreholes can overcome small-scale limitations and has recently gained significant attention. However, no systematic investigation concerning the performance of long electrodes has been performed. We have conducted synthetic studies of LE-ERT to understand its advantages and limitations. We have compared three different approaches of modeling long electrodes, placing particular emphasis on the complete electrode model, to determine which reflects the physical reality best and thus can be used as a benchmark. The conductive cell model led to comparable results but was numerically more expensive. An interesting alternative approach was the shunt electrode model, which does not require discretizing the lateral extension of the casing. Systematic sensitivity studies revealed that model resolution could be enhanced in the borehole depth range through the use of electrodes of different lengths or surface electrodes. Varying contact impedances along different sections of the borehole can change the electric field visibly and influence four-point measurements. Even if large electrode segments show reduced coupling, the influence on voltage measurements was below 4{\%} for realistic contact impedances. We have proven the applicability of LE-ERT for imaging lateral saltwater movement through the simulation of simple scenarios in the context of saltwater intrusion. Our synthetic examples determined the advantage of long electrodes compared with simulations using surface electrodes. The 3D inversion of synthetic data sets revealed that the modeled anomalies could be imaged in most cases. Different models revealed limitations due to poor vertical resolution and supported the usage of casings with different lengths or in combination with surface electrodes to improve resolution.},

abstract = {In order to reduce the computational cost of the simulation of electromagnetic responses in geophysical settings that involve highly heterogeneous media, we develop a multiscale finite volume method with oversampling for the quasi-static Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain. We assume a coarse mesh nested within a fine mesh that accurately discretizes the problem. For each coarse cell, we independently solve a local version of the original Maxwell's system subject to linear boundary conditions on an extended domain, which includes the coarse cell and a neighborhood of fine cells around it. The local Maxwell's system is solved using the fine mesh contained in the extended domain and the mimetic finite volume method. Next, these local solutions (basis functions) together with a weak-continuity condition are used to construct a coarse-mesh version of the global problem. The basis functions can be used to obtain the fine-mesh details from the solution of the coarse-mesh problem. Our approach leads to a significant reduction in the size of the final system of equations and the computational time, while accurately approximating the behavior of the fine-mesh solutions. We demonstrate the performance of our method using a synthetic 3D example of a mineral deposit.},

abstract = {Simulating direct current resistivity, frequency domain electromagnetics and time domain electromagnetics in settings where steel cased boreholes are present is of interest across a range of applications including well-logging, monitoring subsurface injections such as hydraulic fracturing or carbon capture and storage. In some surveys, well-casings have been used as "extended electrodes" for near surface environmental or geotechnical applications. Wells are often cased with steel, which has both a high conductivity and a significant magnetic permeability. The large physical property contrasts as well as the large disparity in length-scales, which are introduced when a steel-cased well is in a modelling domain, makes performing an electromagnetic forward simulation challenging. Using this setting as motivation, we present a finite volume approach for modelling electromagnetic problems on cylindrically symmetric and 3D cylindrical meshes which include an azimuthal discretization. The associated software implementation includes modelling capabilities for direct current resistivity, time domain electromagnetics, and frequency domain electromagnetics for models that include variable electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability. Electric and magnetic fields, fluxes and charges are readily accessible in any simulation so that they can be visualized and interrogated. We demonstrate the value of being able to explore the behaviour of electromagnetic fields and fluxes through examples which revisit a number of foundational papers on DC and electromagnetics in steel-cased wells. The software implementation is open source and included as a part of the SimPEG software ecosystem for simulation and parameter estimation in geophysics.},

abstract = {Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are transforming energy production, but their potential environmental effects remain controversial. We analyzed 141 drinking waterwells across theAppalachian Plateaus physiographic province of northeastern Pennsylvania, examining natural gas concentrations and isotopic signatures with proximity to shale gas wells. Methane was detected in 82{\%} of drinking water samples, with average concentrations six times higher for homes {\textless}1 km from natural gas wells (P = 0.0006). Ethane was 23 times higher in homes {\textless}1 km from gas wells (P = 0.0013); propane was detected in 10 water wells, all within approximately 1 km distance (P = 0.01). Of three factors previously proposed to influence gas concentrations in shallow groundwater (distances to gas wells, valley bottoms, and the Appalachian Structural Front, a proxy for tectonic deformation), distance to gas wells was highly significant for methane concentrations (P = 0.007; multiple regression), whereas distances to valley bottoms and the Appalachian Structural Front were not significant (P = 0.27 and P = 0.11, respectively). Distance to gas wells was also the most significant factor for Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses (P {\textless} 0.01). For ethane concentrations, distance to gas wells was the only statistically significant factor (P {\textless} 0.005). Isotopic signatures ($\delta$13C-CH4, $\delta$13C-C2H6, and $\delta$2H-CH4), hydrocarbon ratios (methane to ethane and propane), and the ratio of the noble gas 4He to CH4 in groundwater were characteristic of a thermally postmature Marcellus-like source in some cases. Overall, our data suggest that some homeowners living {\textless}1 km from gas wells have drinking water contaminated with stray gases.},

abstract = {Directional drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies are dramatically increasing natural-gas extraction. In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg CH(4) L(-1) (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 mg L(-1) (P {\textless} 0.05; n = 34). Average $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37 ± 7‰ and -54 ± 11‰, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). These $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and $\delta$(2)H-CH(4) values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and-possibly-regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.},

abstract = {A new logging method, called induction logging, is described; it measures the conductivity, or resistivity, of the strata traversed by a bore hole. The apparatus, which is briefly described, comprises a coil system coupled with the ground by induction, so that there is no need for direct contact with the mud, or with the formations. For that reason, the method is particularly useful in oil base mud, and it was first applied to that case.$\backslash$nA discussion concerning the respective contribution of each region of ground in the vicinity of the coil system is given. Through the concept of a geometrical factor, it is demonstrated that the total signal, which measures the apparent conductivity, is the summation of the partia1 products - geometrical factor by conductivity - for the different regions of the ground under consideration. It is thus possible to establish, for each type of coil arangement, investigation characteristic as well as departure curves and correction charts for beds of various thicknesses. This should greatly facilitate the quantative interpretation of the field logs, even in cases where such interpretation would have been difficult on electric logs taken with electrodes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIt is also shown that focussing combinations of coils can be used, which give, directly on the recorded log, a value close to the true conductivity, even for fairly thin beds, thus eliminating in most cases the need for corrections. These focussing systems also give a sharper definition of the boundaries between successive strata.},

abstract = {Casing and cement impairment in oil and gas wells can lead to methane migration into the atmosphere and/or into underground sources of drinking water. An analysis of 75,505 compliance reports for 41,381 conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania drilled from January 1, 2000-December 31, 2012, was performed with the objective of determining complete and accurate statistics of casing and cement impairment. Statewide data show a sixfold higher incidence of cement and/or casing issues for shale gas wells relative to conventional wells. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate risk of impairment based on existing data. The model identified both temporal and geographic differences in risk. For post-2009 drilled wells, risk of a cement/casing impairment is 1.57-fold [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) (1.45, 1.67); P {\textless} 0.0001] higher in an unconventional gas well relative to a conventional well drilled within the same time period. Temporal differences between well types were also observed and may reflect more thorough inspections and greater emphasis on finding well leaks, more detailed note taking in the available inspection reports, or real changes in rates of structural integrity loss due to rushed development or other unknown factors. Unconventional gas wells in northeastern (NE) Pennsylvania are at a 2.7-fold higher risk relative to the conventional wells in the same area. The predicted cumulative risk for all wells (unconventional and conventional) in the NE region is 8.5-fold [95{\%} CI (7.16, 10.18); P {\textless} 0.0001] greater than that of wells drilled in the rest of the state.},

abstract = {We present a general formulation for inverting frequency‐ or time‐domain electromagnetic data using an all‐at‐once approach. In this methodology, the forward modeling equations are incorporated as constraints and, thus, we need to solve a constrained optimization problem where the parameters are the electromagnetic fields, the conductivity model, and a set of Lagrange multipliers. This leads to a much larger problem than the traditional unconstrained formulation where only the conductivities are sought. Nevertheless, experience shows that the constrained problem can be solved faster than the unconstrained one. The primary reasons are that the forward problem does not have to be solved exactly until the very end of the optimization process, and that permitting the fields to be away from their constrained values in the initial stages introduces flexibility so that a stationary point of the objective function is found more quickly.

abstract = {As motivation for considering new electromagnetic techniques for hydraulic fracture monitoring, we develop a simple financial model for the net present value offered by geophysical characterization to reduce the error in stimulated reservoir volume calculations. This model shows that even a 5{\%} improvement in stimulated reservoir volume for a 1 billion barrel (bbl.) field results in over 1 billion U.S. dollars (US{\$}) in net present value over 24 years for US{\$}100/bbl. oil and US{\$}0.5 billion for US{\$}50/bbl. oil. The application of conductivity upscaling, often used in electromagnetic modeling to reduce mesh size and thus simulation runtimes, is shown to be inaccurate for the high electrical contrasts needed to represent steel-cased wells in the earth. Fine-scale finite-difference modeling with 12.22-mm cells to capture the steel casing and fractures shows that the steel casing provides a direct current pathway to a created fracture that significantly enhances the response compared with neglecting the steel casing. We consider conductively enhanced proppant, such as coke-breeze-coated sand, and a highly saline brine solution to produce electrically conductive fractures. For a relatively small frac job at a depth of 3 km, involving 5,000 bbl. of slurry and a source midpoint to receiver separation of 50 m, the models show that the conductively enhanced proppant produces a 15{\%} increase in the electric field strength (in-line with the transmitter) in a 10-$\Omega$m background. In a 100-$\Omega$m background, the response due to the proppant increases to 213{\%}. Replacing the conductive proppant by brine with a concentration of 100,000-ppm NaCl, the field strength is increased by 23{\%} in the 100-$\Omega$m background and by 2.3{\%} in the 10-$\Omega$m background. All but the 100,000-ppm NaCl brine in a 10-$\Omega$m background produce calculated fracture-induced electric field increases that are significantly above 2{\%}, a value that has been demonstrated to be observable in field measurements.},

abstract = {Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) methods are highly efficient tools for assessing the Earth's conductivity structures in a large area at low cost. However, the configuration of AEM measurements, which typically have widely distributed transmitter-receiver pairs, makes the rigorous modelling and interpretation extremely time-consuming in 3-D. Excessive overcomputing can occur when working on a large mesh covering the entire survey area and inverting all soundings in the data set. We propose two improvements. The first is to use a locally optimized mesh for each AEM sounding for the forward modelling and calculation of sensitivity. This dedicated local mesh is small with fine cells near the sounding location and coarse cells far away in accordance with EM diffusion and the geometric decay of the signals. Once the forward problem is solved on the local meshes, the sensitivity for the inversion on the global mesh is available through quick interpolation. Using local meshes for AEM forward modelling avoids unnecessary computing on fine cells on a global mesh that are far away from the sounding location. Since local meshes are highly independent, the forward modelling can be efficiently parallelized over an array of processors. The second improvement is random and dynamic down-sampling of the soundings. Each inversion iteration only uses a random subset of the soundings, and the subset is reselected for every iteration. The number of soundings in the random subset, determined by an adaptive algorithm, is tied to the degree of model regularization. This minimizes the overcomputing caused by working with redundant soundings. Our methods are compared against conventional methods and tested with a synthetic example. We also invert a field data set that was previously considered to be too large to be practically inverted in 3-D. These examples show that our methodology can dramatically reduce the processing time of 3-D inversion to a practical level without losing resolution. Any existing modelling technique can be included into our framework of mesh decoupling and adaptive sampling to accelerate large-scale 3-D EM inversions.},

abstract = {We study the theoretical response of electromagnetically energized steel casing in the presence of subsurface variations of electrical resistivity. Casing is energized with a finite-size solenoid antenna located along the axis of the borehole. Measurements consist of the azimuthal component of the electric field acquired either on the surface or in a separate well in the same hydrocarbon field. We assume two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric variations of subsurface electrical resistivity and casing excitation. Simulations of electromagnetic (EM) fields excited by energized steel casing are performed with a goal-oriented hp-adaptive finite-element method that automatically generates a sequence of optimal grids delivering exponential convergence rates in terms of the EM fields at the receiver antennas against CPU time. This advanced finite-element method enables accu-rate modeling of problems with high conductivity contrasts inlarge computational domains. Numerical simulations quantify the measurement sensitivity to variations of frequency, distance from casing to receivers, resistivity of the target oil-bearing layer, and pistonlike radial invasion of water within a target layer initially saturated with oil. When receivers are placed in a nearby well, numerical results indicate that measurements exhibit the largest sensitivity to the target (oil-saturated) layer when the transmitter or receiver antenna is located just above the target layer, and another antenna is located below the target layer. A frequency range from 5-30 Hz provides optimal results for the detection of oil-bearing layers and estimation of radial extent of water invasion. Large horizontal distances (up to 1500 m) between transmitter and receivers and a background material with resistivity above 50 Omega m also enhance the measurement sensitivity to radial variations of water invasion. This sensitivity can be as large as 15{\%}-20{\%} of the measured electric field.},

@article{Nekut1995a,
abstract = {The applicability of crosswell electromagnetic (EM) tomography is limited when the boreholes are steel cased. Steel casing is typically eight orders of magni- tude more conductive than the formations around the borehole. Consequently, the high frequency signals which are needed to resolve the formation conductiv- ity distribution in the interwell region cannot be radi- ated or received by antennas inside the casing. Intro- duction of small insulating gaps in the casing eliminates these problems by creating ports where signals can exit and enter the casing, making the casing an electric bipole antenna. The gapped casing can be operated in a shorted-port or open-port mode. In the shorted-port mode, the voltage is specified at a source port, and the current is measured at all the remaining shorted ports. In the open-port mode, the current is specified at a source port, and the voltage is measured at all the remaining open ports. For high-frequency shorted-port operation, the effective length of the casing bipole antenna is determined by the skin depth in the formations surrounding the casing. For high- frequency open-port operation, the effective length of the casing bipole antenna is determined by the casing gap interval, provided that it is less than the formation skin depth. The open-port mode is preferred. The interval between casing gaps is determined mainly by the well spacing. If the effective bipole length is proportional to the well spacing, the cross- well signal-to-noise ratio is approximately independent of the well spacing and the interwell resolution is approximately proportional to the well spacing at constant source input power. For large well spacings, gapped casing antennas outperform open-hole tools. Steel-cased wells completed or retrofitted with insu- lating gaps offer a stable, low-cost, permanent set of electrodes to implement long-term monitoring of pe- troleum reservoir fluid movements. Gapped casings offer a practical way to achieve high-frequency, wide- aperture EM tomographic datasets at large well spac- ings. Gapped casings can also be used for deep EM probing of the formations around a single well},

abstract = {Simulations and inversions of electromagnetic geophysical data are paramount for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data. Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions. This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical properties, sources, formulation of the discrete problem to be solved, the resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part of the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SIMPEG (http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through two synthetic examples and one field example. The first example shows the application of the common framework for 1D time domain and frequency domain inversions. The second is a field example that demonstrates a 1D inversion of electromagnetic data collected over the Bookpurnong Irrigation District in Australia. The final example is a 3D example which shows how the modular implementation is used to compute the sensitivity for a parametric model where a transmitter is positioned inside a steel cased well.},

abstract = {A new electromagnetic logging method, in which the source is a horizontal loop coaxial with a cased drill hole and the secondary axial fields are measured at depth within the casing, has been analyzed. The analysis, which is for an idealized model of an infinite pipe in a conductive whole space, has shown that the casing and formation are uncoupled at the low frequencies that would be used in field studies. The field inside the casing may be found by first finding the field in the formation and then using this field as an incident field for the pipe alone. This result permits the formation response to be recovered from the measured field in the borehole by applying a correction for the known properties of the casing. If the casing response cannot be accurately predicted, a separate logging tool employing a higher frequency transmitter could be used to determine the required casing parameters in the vicinity of the receiver. This logging technique shows excellent sensitivity to changes in formation conduct...},

abstract = {The implementation of a low-frequency electromagnetic induction tool for propped-fracture detection and diagnostics requires in-depth examination of the reliability and accuracy of the method across fractures with realistic geomechanical features. Likewise, the method relies on the effective placement of electrically conductive proppant within the generated fractures for measurable sensitivity. We invoke a fast Fourier-transform-based volume integral equation simulation method for forward modeling to simulate the electromagnetic response of realistic fracture geometries generated in hydro-fracturing operations and under practical rock conditions. Improved performance is achieved by removing model features which are of little significance to the results and yet cause a significant computational overhead. To properly account for the effective proppant conductivity, we introduce a new technique for the measurement of proppant conductivity using a resistivity core holder. The conductivity of petroleum coke—a potential candidate to be used in the field—is tested in the laboratory. Resulting measurements are used to forward simulate the tool's response to multiple fracture geometries and sizes. Distinct results are obtained for fractures with different spatial distributions of proppant, indicating the possibility of distinguishing between them using a future inverse solver.},

abstract = {Evaluation of hydraulic fractures has been under intensive study since the last decade. Among published works, only a few have included casing effects. This paper focuses on the through-casing electromagnetic (EM) induction imaging method that evaluates hydraulic fractures with enhanced contrasts. An experimental system and an inverse scattering algorithm are presented. The laboratory scaled experimental system is built for the feasibility study of the EM induction imaging method for the through-casing hydraulic fracture evaluation. To develop the inverse scattering algorithm, fractures outside boreholes with metallic casing are modeled by a novel hybrid approximation method. This method combines the distorted Born approximation and the mixed order stabilized bi-conjugate gradient fast Fourier transform method to solve the forward scattering problem. The variational Born iterative method is applied to solve the nonlinear inverse problem iteratively. Experimental results show that the inverse scattering algorithm is effective forEM contrast enhanced through-casing hydraulic fracture evaluation.},

abstract = {We simulate direct current (DC) borehole resistivity measurements acquired in steel-cased deviated wells for the assessment of rock formation properties. The assumed data acquisition configuration considers one current (emitter) and three voltage (collector) electrodes that are utilized to measure the second difference of the electric potential along the well trajectory. We assume a homogeneous, 1.27-cm-thick steel casing with resistivity equal to 10-5 $\Omega${\textperiodcentered} m. Simulations are performed with two different numerical methodologies. The first one is based on transferring two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric optimal grids to a three-dimensional (3D) simulation software. The second one automatically produces optimal 3D grids yielded by a 3D self-adaptive goal-oriented algorithm. Both methodologies utilize high-order finite elements (FE) that are specially well-suited for problems with high-contrast coefficients and rapid spatial variations of the electric field, as it occurs in simulations that involve steel-cased wells. The method based on transferring 2D-optimal grids is efficient in terms of CPU time (few seconds per logging position). Unfortunately, it may produce inaccurate 3D simulations in deviated wells, even though the error remains below 1{\%} for the axisymmetric (vertical) well. The method based on optimal 3D grids, although less efficient in terms of CPU time (few hours per logging position), produces more accurate results that are validated by a built-in a posteriori error estimator. This paper provides the first existing simulations of through-casing resistivity measurements in deviated wells. Simulated resistivity measurements indicate that, for a 30° deviated well, measurements in conductive layers 0.01$\Omega${\textperiodcentered} m) are similar to those obtained in vertical wells. However, in resistive layers (10,000 $\Omega${\textperiodcentered} m), we observe 100{\%} larger readings in the 30° deviated well. This difference becomes 3,000{\%} for the case of a 60° deviated well. For this highly-deviated well, readings corresponding to the conductive formation layer are about 30{\%} smaller in magnitude than those in a vertical well. Shoulder effects significantly vary in deviated wells. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.},

abstract = {A closed-form solution for a basic model of the through-casing resistivity measurement is found.The so- lution reveals fundamental characteristics of the mea- surement and the dependence of these characteristics on the parameters of the casing and formation. We start our consideration with an analysis of the cur- rent distribution in the vicinity of a single electrode en- ergizing the casing. This analysis shows that the distri- bution becomes axially symmetrical at a distance of just a few radii from the injection point. As a consequence, the number and the physical location of the electrodes used to inject electric current become unimportant if the measurement electrodes are not placed too close to the sensing electrodes. We also derive a closed-form solution for the distri- bution of the current flowing in a homogeneous casing embedded in a homogeneous formation. This consider- ation results in an expression specifying the so-called characteristic length. The electric field potential is ana- lyzed as a function of the vertical and radial distances from the current injection electrode. Explicit closed- form expressions are derived for the electric potential distribution at a distance that is greater or less than the characteristic length. A transition from a cylindrical to spherical pattern of the currentflowoccurs at aradial dis- tance controlled by the characteristic length. This phe- nomenon bounds the “current tube” resistance.Anana- lytical result is also found for the casing surrounded with a homogeneous cement sheath. The concept of the characteristic length is related closely to the geometrical factor of the through-casing resistivitymeasurement.It followsfromoursolution that the geometrical factor displays a significant dependence on the resistivity of the formation and the parameters of the casing. This dependence should be taken into account in the quantitative interpretation of through-casing resistivity logs.},

abstract = {The applicability of crosswell electromagnetic (EM) tomography is limited when the boreholes are steel cased. Steel casing is typically eight orders of magni- tude more conductive than the formations around the borehole. Consequently, the high frequency signals which are needed to resolve the formation conductiv- ity distribution in the interwell region cannot be radi- ated or received by antennas inside the casing. Intro- duction of small insulating gaps in the casing eliminates these problems by creating ports where signals can exit and enter the casing, making the casing an electric bipole antenna. The gapped casing can be operated in a shorted-port or open-port mode. In the shorted-port mode, the voltage is specified at a source port, and the current is measured at all the remaining shorted ports. In the open-port mode, the current is specified at a source port, and the voltage is measured at all the remaining open ports. For high-frequency shorted-port operation, the effective length of the casing bipole antenna is determined by the skin depth in the formations surrounding the casing. For high- frequency open-port operation, the effective length of the casing bipole antenna is determined by the casing gap interval, provided that it is less than the formation skin depth. The open-port mode is preferred. The interval between casing gaps is determined mainly by the well spacing. If the effective bipole length is proportional to the well spacing, the cross- well signal-to-noise ratio is approximately independent of the well spacing and the interwell resolution is approximately proportional to the well spacing at constant source input power. For large well spacings, gapped casing antennas outperform open-hole tools. Steel-cased wells completed or retrofitted with insu- lating gaps offer a stable, low-cost, permanent set of electrodes to implement long-term monitoring of pe- troleum reservoir fluid movements. Gapped casings offer a practical way to achieve high-frequency, wide- aperture EM tomographic datasets at large well spac- ings. Gapped casings can also be used for deep EM probing of the formations around a single well},

abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing is an essential way to improve the production of unconventional shale oil and gas. It is important to characterize the produced fractures using either acoustic or electromagnetic (EM) methods. Conventional EM solvers in the low-frequency range face significant challenges by such multiscale problems where the fracture width is orders of magnitude smaller than its diameters. Furthermore, the cased borehole environment is extremely difficult to simulate with conventional EM solvers due to meshing difficulties and the multiscale nature of the problem. In this paper, we develop a hybrid distorted Born approximation and 3-D mixed ordered stabilized biconju- gate gradient fast Fourier transform (DBA-BCGS-FFT) method to simulate the very challenging 2-D, 2-D-axisymmetric, and 3-D hydraulic fracture models under both open and cased bore- hole environments. Numerical examples show that this method has orders of magnitude higher efficiency than the finite element method. The capabilities of the DBA-BCGS-FFT method for the induction tool fracture mapping are demonstrated by comparing with laboratory experimental results and other reference results.},

abstract = {The presence of steel-cased wells and other infrastructure causes a significant change in the electromagnetic fields that has to be taken into consideration in modeling and interpretation of field data. A realistic and accurate simulation requires the borehole casing to be incorporated into the modeling scheme, which is numerically challenging. Due to the huge conductivity contrast between the casing and surrounding media, a spatial discretization that provides accurate results at different spatial scales ranging from millimeters to hundreds of meters is required. In this paper, we present a full 3D frequency-domain electromagnetic modeling based on a parallel finite-difference algorithm considering the casing effect and investigate its applicability on the borehole-to-surface configuration of the Hontom{\{}{\'{i}}{\}}n CO2 storage site. To guarantee a robust solution of linear systems with highly ill-conditioned matrices caused by huge conductivity contrasts and multiple spatial scales in the model, we employ direct sparse solvers. Different scenarios are simulated in order to study the influence of the source position, conductivity model, and the effect of the steel casing on the measured data. Several approximations of the real hollow casing that allow for a large reduction in the number of elements in the resulting meshes are studied. A good agreement between the modeled responses and the real field data demonstrates the feasibility of simulating casing effects in complex geological areas. The steel casing of the well greatly increases the amplitude of the surface electromagnetic fields and thus improves the signal-to-noise ratio and the sensitivity to deep targets.},

We investigate the applicability of controlled-source electromagnetic methods to monitor fluid movements in a German oilfield (Bockstedt, onshore Northwest Germany) as injected brines (highly saline formation water) have much lower electrical resistivity than the oil within the reservoir. The main focus of this study is on controlled-source electromagnetic simulations to test the sensitivity of various source–receiver configurations. The background model for the simulations is based on two-dimensional inversion of magnetotelluric data gathered across the oil field and calibrated with resistivity logs. Three-dimensional modelling results suggest that controlled-source electromagnetic methods are sensitive to resistivity changes at reservoir depths, but the effect is difficult to resolve with surface measurements only. Resolution increases significantly if sensors or transmitters can be placed in observation wells closer to the reservoir. In particular, observation of the vertical electric field component in shallow boreholes and/or use of source configurations consisting of combinations of vertical and horizontal dipoles are promising. Preliminary results from a borehole-to-surface controlled-source electromagnetic field survey carried out in spring 2014 are in good agreement with the modelling studies.},

abstract = {An electrical-resistivity survey was completed at the T tank farm at the Hanford nuclear site in Washington State, U.S.A. The purpose of the survey was to define the lateral extent of waste plumes in the vadose zone in and around the tank farm. The T tank farm consists of single-shell tanks that historically have leaked and many liquid-waste-disposal facilities that provide a good target for resistivity mapping. Given that the site is highly industrialized with near-surface metallic infrastructure that potentially could mask any interpretable waste plume, it was necessary to use the many wells around the site as long electrodes. To accommodate the long electrodes and to simulate the effects of a linear conductor, the resistivity inversion code was modified to assign low-resistivity values to the well's location. The forward model within the resistivity code was benchmarked for accuracy against an analytic solution, and the inverse model was tested for its ability to recreate images of a hypothetical target. The results of the tank-farm field survey showed large, low-resistivity targets beneath the disposal areas that coincided with the conceptual hydrogeologic models developed regarding the releases. Additionally, in areas of minimal infrastructure, the long-electrode method matched the lateral footprint of a 3D surface-resistivity survey with reasonable fidelity. Based on these results, the long-electrode resistivity method may provide a new strategy for environmental characterization at highly industrialized sites, provided a sufficient number and density of wells exist. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2010 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

Probably the most curious aspect is that it doesn't chase the holy grail of geophysics—high resolution.},

abstract = {The goal of this project is to develop techniques for monitoring hydraulic fractures in reservoirs by injecting electrically conductive, dielectric, or magnetically permeable proppants. The contrasts between the properties of the proppants and the subsurface provided the basis for imaging using geophysical methods. The initial experiments focused on a series of small, shallow fractures; however, the goal of the project is to develop methods applicable to oil-field fractures. The project began by screening different proppant types using laboratory and numerical analyses that have been ongoing by researchers at the Advanced Energy Consortium (AEC). This work identified Loresco coke breeze and steel shot as materials that could create significant electrical or magnetic contrasts with most geological formations. These proppants were tested by creating hydraulic fractures in a shallow field setting consisting of highly weathered residual saprolite near Clemson University in western South Carolina. Six hydraulic fractures were created in highly monitored cells by injecting the contrasting proppants at a depth of approximately 1.5 m. This created sub-horizontal fractures filled with proppant approximately 10 mm thick and extending 3 to 5 m in maximum dimension. Each cell had a dense array of electrodes and magnetic sensors on the surface, as well as four shallow vertical electrode arrays that were used to obtain data before and after hydraulic fracturing. Net vertical displacement, cores and trenching were used to characterize the fracture geometries. Hydraulic fracture geometries were estimated by inverting pre-and post-injection geophysical data using various codes. Data from cores and excavation show that the hydraulic fractures formed a saucer-shape with a preferred propagation in the horizontal direction. The geophysical inversions generated images with remarkably similar form, size, and location to the ground truth from direct observation. Displacement and tilt data appear promising as a constraint on fracture geometry.},

abstract = {A new electromagnetic logging method, in which the source is a horizontal loop coaxial with a cased drill hole and the secondary axial fields are measured at depth within the casing, has been analyzed. The analysis, which is for an idealized model of an infinite pipe in a conductive whole space, has shown that the casing and formation are uncoupled at the low frequencies that would be used in field studies. The field inside the casing may be found by first finding the field in the formation and then using this field as an incident field for the pipe alone. This result permits the formation response to be recovered from the measured field in the borehole by applying a correction for the known properties of the casing. If the casing response cannot be accurately predicted, a separate logging tool employing a higher frequency transmitter could be used to determine the required casing parameters in the vicinity of the receiver. This logging technique shows excellent sensitivity to changes in formation conduct...},

@article{Borner2015,
abstract = {We present a numerical study for 3D time-lapse electromagnetic monitoring of a fictitious CO2 sequestration using the geometry of a real geological site and a suite of suitable electromagnetic methods with different source/receiver configurations and different sensitivity patterns. All available geological information is processed and directly implemented into the computational domain, which is discretized by unstructured tetrahedral grids. We thus demonstrate the performance capability of our numerical simulation techniques. The scenario considers a CO2 injection in approximately 1100 m depth. The expected changes in conductivity were inferred from preceding laboratory measurements. A resistive anomaly is caused within the conductive brines of the undisturbed reservoir horizon. The resistive nature of the anomaly is enhanced by the CO2 dissolution regime, which prevails in the high-salinity environment. Due to the physicochemical properties of CO2, the affected portion of the subsurface is laterally widespread but very thin. We combine controlled-source electromagnetics, borehole transient electromagnetics, and the direct-current resistivity method to perform a virtual experiment with the aim of scrutinizing a set of source/receiver configurations with respect to coverage, resolution, and detectability of the anomalous CO2 plume prior to the field survey. Our simulation studies are carried out using the 3D codes developed in our working group. They are all based on linear and higher order Lagrange and N{\'{e}}d{\'{e}}lec finite-element formulations on unstructured grids, providing the necessary flexibility with respect to the complex real-world geometry. We provide different strategies for addressing the accuracy of numerical simulations in the case of arbitrary structures. The presented computations demonstrate the expected great advantage of positioning transmitters or receivers close to the target. For direct-current geoelectrics, 50{\%} change in electric potential may be detected even at the Earth's surface. Monitoring with inductive methods is also promising. For a well-positioned surface transmitter, more than 10{\%} difference in the vertical electric field is predicted for a receiver located 200 m above the target. Our borehole transient electromagnetics results demonstrate that traditional transient electromagnetics with a vertical magnetic dipole source is not well suited for monitoring a thin horizontal resistive target. This is due to the mainly horizontal current system, which is induced by a vertical magnetic dipole.},

abstract = {Gas hydrates are a potential energy resource, a possible factor in climate change and an exploration geohazard. The University of Toronto has deployed a permanent seafloor time-domain controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) system offshore Vancouver Island, within the framework of the NEPTUNE Canada underwater cabled obser-vatory. Hydrates are known to be present in the area and due to their electrically resistive nature can be monitored by 5 permanent electric field receivers. However, two cased boreholes may be drilled near the CSEM site in the near future. To un-derstand any potential distortions of the electric fields due to the metal, we model the marine electromagnetic response of a conductive steel borehole casing. First, we consider the commonly used canonical model consisting of a 100m, 100 m thick resistive hydrocarbon layer embedded at a depth of 1000 m in a 1m conductive host medium, with the addition of a typical steel production casing extending from the seafloor to the resistive zone. Results show that in both the frequency and time domains the distortion produced by the casing occurs at smaller transmitter-receiver offsets than the offsets required to detect the resistive layer. Second, we consider the experimentally determined model of the offshore Vancouver Island hydrate zone, consisting of a 5.5m, 36m thick hydrate layer overlying a 0.7m sedimentary half-space, with the addition of two borehole casings extending 300 m into the seafloor. In this case, results show that the distortion produced by casings located within a 100 m safety zone of the CSEM system will be measured at 4 of the 5 receivers. We conclude that the boreholes must be positioned at least 200 m away from the CSEM array so as to minimize the effects of the casings.},

@article{Caudillo-Mata2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V. Electromagnetic simulations of complex geologic settings are computationally expensive. One reason for this is the fact that a fine mesh is required to accurately discretize the electrical conductivity model of a given setting. This conductivity model may vary over several orders of magnitude and these variations can occur over a large range of length scales. Using a very fine mesh for the discretization of this setting leads to the necessity to solve a large system of equations that is often difficult to deal with. To keep the simulations computationally tractable, coarse meshes are often employed for the discretization of the model. Such coarse meshes typically fail to capture the fine-scale variations in the conductivity model resulting in inaccuracies in the predicted data. In this work, we introduce a framework for constructing a coarse-mesh or upscaled conductivity model based on a prescribed fine-mesh model. Rather than using analytical expressions, we opt to pose upscaling as a parameter estimation problem. By solving an optimization problem, we obtain a coarse-mesh conductivity model. The optimization criterion can be tailored to the survey setting in order to produce coarse models that accurately reproduce the predicted data generated on the fine mesh. This allows us to upscale arbitrary conductivity structures, as well as to better understand the meaning of the upscaled quantity. We use 1D and 3D examples to demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to emulate the behavior of the heterogeneity in the fine-mesh conductivity model, and to produce an accurate description of the desired predicted data obtained by using a coarse mesh in the simulation process.},

Modeling shows that the electromagnetic fields at reservoir depths can be 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than those on the seabed, thus opening up the possibility to see deeper or detect and monitor smaller targets. In the case of measurements inside metal casing, the use of reciprocity to interchange the source and receiver allows the casing conductor to be considered as an antenna. This antenna is excited by a source inside the casing, which induces a current flowing along the casing conductor. Based on the current distribution, a casing dipole moment and an equivalent length were derived for the transverse magnetic (TM) mode. In the frequency range of interest (0.1–10 Hz), the increase in field strength (resulting fromsea-to-borehole measurements) is not lost to the casing attenuation for either the TM or the transverse electric (TE) mode.

abstract = {Methods using dc electrical arrays to measure for- mation resistivity through casing have relied on ap- proximate forms for the current and potential distribu- tions to derive a simple relationship between the formation resistivity and the transverse resistance calculated from measurements of the potential and its second derivative inside the casing. We have derived a numerical solution for the potentials and their deriva- tives to examine the accuracy of the approximate forms for casing of finite-length, annular zones of varying radius, and for vertical discontinuities such as layers or abrupt changes in annular zone radius. For typical conductivity contrasts between the casing and formation, the approximate relationships may be off by as much as 60 percent for long casing and may show variations of 20 to 30 percent as the electrode array moves along the casing. In principle an iterative scheme could be devised to correct the readings if high accuracy was required. The numerical results show that to first order the current flow from the casing is radial, and that all the analytic expressions based on this assumption for evaluating layer resolution and the effects of annular layers are valid. An interesting byproduct of this study has been the discovery that the distortion of the potentials in a nearby well by an annular disk (e.g., an injected steam zone) surrounding the current injection well is greater if the injection well is cased. Crosswell resistivity surveys appear feasible if one of the wells is cased},

abstract = {Simulations and inversions of geophysical electromagnetic data are paramount for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data. Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions. This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical properties, sources, definition of the discrete problem to be solved, the resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part of the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SimPEG (http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through two synthetic examples. The first example shows the application of the common framework for 1D time domain and frequency domain inversions. The second example demonstrates how the modular implementation is used to compute the sensitivity for a parametric model where a transmitter is positioned inside a steel cased well.},

@article{Kaufman1993,
abstract = {Electrical logging in cased holes is a subject of strong current interest. In this paper we develop the conventional theory of physical responses of electrical logging through casing where the formation resistivity changes vertically and where the conductance of the casing varies. The theory is developed for a four-electrode sonde with one current electrode, and three receiver electrodes that measure current leakage into the formation. All the theoretical developments in the paper are derived using approximate transmission-line theory. An expression for the array coefficient is first derived and then used to obtain an expression for the apparent conductivity of the formation. Then a relation is established between the array coefficient, geometrical factor and conductance of the casing. This step led to a method of measuring casing conductance. Knowing casing conductance, the response of the array to vertical changes in formation conductivity is measurable. It was established, that when the array length is less than the thickness of the formation layer, the measured apparent conductivity is equivalent to the true conductivity of the formation, unlike the case of normal and induction logs. It was also established that measurement of apparent conductivity can be made accurately inside a casing of finite length when it essentially exceeds the length of the electrode array. The results contained in this paper show that electrical logging through casing is possible in wells with conventional casing strings that penetrate layered sedimentary formations.},

@article{wuhabashy1994,
abstract = {Most wells in oil fields are cased with metal. The feasibility of measuring low-frequency magnetic fields through such steel-cased wells is of great interest for monitoring fluid movement during production. We report on experimental and modeling results regarding the effect of steel casing on electromagnetic signals transmitted through them. This effect includes the attenuation and phase shift of a signal diffusing through the casing wall. Sample casings are studied under low field strength in the linear regime where the casing's electrical properties are independent of the applied signals. Frequency spectra are measured for transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic polariza- tions from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz. Numerical models, devel- oped to simulate the casing response, match the ex- perimental data very well. Finally, studies of the effects of the earth's magnetic field and casing rema- nent magnetization show that these steady biases do not affect the ac signal detection.},
